# Game Description
A platform fighter game for 2-4 players, featuring 4 unique characters and 2 stages! To win, hit the opponents with  one of your bird "bombs!" A unique combat system where you have to drop your weapon behind you on your opponent to take them down!

Each bird has their own unique stats- some are faster and have smaller hitboxes, but a weaker jump, while others may be slower with a bigger hitbox, but have larger bombs! Try them all and find your favorite!

Flap your wings to get the height advantage on your opponent! Drop below platforms for cover from your opponents' bombardment! Take advantage and win the day!
